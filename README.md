# Automatic-Irrigation
The fundamental objective of this system is to help farmers with their irrigation process. 
The system will use different sensors to measure the soil moisture content and the level of water inside the tank. Then, the system will inform farmers whenever the pump changes its status through display or SMS. This system also includes two pumps; one
for watering the plants and the second one is for supplying water to the tank.
